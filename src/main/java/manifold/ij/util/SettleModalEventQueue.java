/**
 * This is a utility for basically pumping messages in-place until there are
 * none left in the queue. It's very handy for cases where one or more messages
 * are in the queue as a result of prior calls to EventQueue.invokeLater() and
 * you need those messages to be processed before you check state or whatever.
 * The idea is that you want to distribute all those messages and messages
 * resulting from distributing them etc. When there are no more messages in the
 * queue you can proceed with whatever.
 * <p/>
 * Simply call SettleModelEventQueue.instance().run()

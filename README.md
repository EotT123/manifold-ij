# manifold-ij
An IntelliJ IDEA plugin for Manifold

# Description
Use the [Manifold IntelliJ IDEA plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10057-manifold) to experience Manifold to its fullest.

The plugin currently supports most high-level IntelliJ features including:
* Feature highlighting
* Error reporting
* Code completion
* Navigation
* Usage searching
* Refactoring
* Structural typing
* Debugging

IntelliJ exposes all of Manifold's features. Use code completion to discover and use type manifolds, extension
methods and structural interfaces. Jump directly from usages of extension methods to their declarations.
Likewise, jump directly from references to data source elements and find usages of them in your code.
Watch your JSON, images, properties, templates, and custom type manifolds come alive as types.
Changes you make are instantly available in your code:

Install the plugin directly from IntelliJ via: `Settings | Plugins | Browse Repositories | Manifold`

Visit the [Manifold website](http://manifold.systems/) for more information.
